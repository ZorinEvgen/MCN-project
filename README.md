# MCN-project

MCN-project is my first project designed to be integrated into my current organization (MCN is an acronym).

The main purpose of the project is education: java skills development, practicing some popular development instruments
like Git, hibernate, spring and others which could become necessary in the process.

The idea is to create a web application and database to store, read, update and delete data collected and used in organization 
about real estate objects of Moscow city property.
